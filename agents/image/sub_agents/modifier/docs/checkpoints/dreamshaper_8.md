model name: dreamshaper_8

the primary goal is still towards art and illustrations. Being good at everything comes second.

Suggested settings:
- I had CLIP skip 2 on some pics, the model works with that too.
- I have ENSD set to 31337, in case you need to reproduce some results, but it doesn't guarantee it.
- All of them had highres.fix or img2img at higher resolution. Some even have ADetailer. Careful with that tho, as it tends to make all faces look the same.
- I don't use "restore faces".
